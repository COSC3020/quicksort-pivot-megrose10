# Quicksort Pivots

in the lectures I only briefly mentioned strategies for determining a good pivot
for quicksort. The implementation on the slides simply picks the leftmost
element in the part of the array that we consider as a pivot. I also mentioned a
few other ways of picking a good pivot, e.g. randomly.

Median-of-three is also a good way of picking a pivot -- inspect the first,
middle, and last elements of the part of the array under consideration and
choose the median value. Using the probabilities for picking a pivot in a
particular part of the array (in the same way as we did on slide 34), argue
whether this method is more or less (or equally) likely to pick a good pivot
compared to simply choosing the first element. Assume that all permutations are
equally likely, i.e. the input array is ordered randomly.

I used the lecture slides/video on sorting, quicksort to look at slide 34. 

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.

Your answer must derive probabilities for choosing a good pivot and
quantitatively reason with them.

Finding a good pivot using this approach will be more likey to pick a good pivot. While, from slide 34, only looking at the first number could be the greatest or least greatest number, with the comparisons being $/theta$ (nlogn), where as with chosing a median, the value does not have as great of a possibility of being on one side or the other.
